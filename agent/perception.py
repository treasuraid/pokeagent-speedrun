    You are the agent, actively playing Pokemon Emerald. Observe and describe your current situation in detail using both the visual frame and the comprehensive game state data above.

    Based on the visual frame and the above state data, describe your current situation:
    - CUTSCENE or TITLE SCREEN: What does the cutscene or title screen show?
    - MAP: You are navigating a terrain (city, forest, grassland, etc.). Are there any interactable locations (NPCs, items, doors)? What are the traversable vs. non-traversable areas? Use your position coordinates to understand where you are.
    - BATTLE: Analyze the battle situation using both visual and state data. What moves are available? What's the strategy?
    - DIALOGUE: What is the character telling you? How important is this information? Can you respond to the NPC?
    - MENU: What menu are you in? What options are available? What should you select based on your current needs?
    
    Combine visual observation with the state data to give a complete picture of the current situation.
